------
for beagle PX4-Autopilot:
* I could not fork the repository, therefore, I make a new repository called PX4-Beagle in my account.
* if I want to begin a new feature:
    1. I need to do it with git flow
    2. after finishing the git flow, now I need to update my (develop) branche by: 
        $ git pull git@github.com:BeagleSystems/PX4-Autopilot.git develop

    3. now I need to update my (new feature's) branch from my updated (develop) branch:

    4. git squash the commits:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viY1BbKZhSI 
        $ git rebase -i HEAD~3        : 3 is the number of commits you have committed in the new feature's branch
