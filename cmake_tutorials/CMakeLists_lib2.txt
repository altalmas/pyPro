# Also, we can do another CMakeLists.txt inside the library directory (blah/CMakeLists.txt)
there we will have :

            hello_project
                |- CMakeLists.txt
                |- main.cpp
                |- blah
                |   |- CMakeLists.txt
                |   |- Blah.cpp
                |   |- include
                |   |    |- Blah.h

- blah/CMakeLists.txt:
        add_library(mylib STATIC Blah.cpp)
        target_include_directories(mylib PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include)       # the blah/include has the .h files

- hello_project/CMakeLists.txt:

        cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

        set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARDS 17)
        set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARDS_REQUIRED ON)

        project(hello VERSION 1.0)

        add_subdirectory(blah)                             # added this

        add_executable(hello main.cpp)
        target_link_libraries(hello PUBLIC mylib)          # note this
