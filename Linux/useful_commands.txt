find a text in files in directory:
    $ grep -r <text_pattern_to_search> directory_or_path_to_search
    $ grep -r 'hello world' ~/myDir/myBranch/Another
    

directly link (and move) whats in folder 1 to folder 2:
    1. go to the folder where you want to make a link called my_link, 
    where this link is going to jump you to another folder:
    
                                            For example (before linking):

                                                ~/my_folder
                                                    |- file1.txt
                                                    |- file2.txt


                                                ~/my_jumped_folder
                                                    |- yes1.txt
                                                    |- yes2.txt

    $ cd ~/my_folder
    $ ln -s ~/my_jumped_folder my_link
    
                                            result (after linking):

                                                ~/my_folder
                                                    |- file1.txt
                                                    |- file2.txt
                                                    |- my_link
                                                        |- yes1.txt
                                                        |- yes2.txt


                                                ~/my_jumped_folder
                                                    |- yes1.txt
                                                    |- yes2.txt
