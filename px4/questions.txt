Q0: how to debug ? I mean how to go through modules and functions in a raw?

Q1: when the vehicle is returning (RLT), first when it finished the missoin it goes into loiter, 
and after a moment, it goes into RLT and says (RTL: landing at home position). so the question is
from where does the rtl.cpp begin?

Q2: what is the differece between NAV_CMD_*** and VEHCILE_CMD_*** ? (when to use this, when to use that?)

Q1: in src/modules/navigator/mission.cpp/set_mission_item ( line 680)
    _navigator-> set_can_loiter_at_sp(true);

    what happens next ? I mean where is the code that makes the loiter.cpp activate?
        A1: if you read after it in the else-statement: setLoiterItemFromCurrentPositionSetpoint (mission_block.cpp)
